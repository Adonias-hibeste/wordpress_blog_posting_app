# Bolenav Blog App

This Android application fetches and displays blog posts from the Bolenav WordPress API ([https://blog.bolenav.com/wp-json/](https://blog.bolenav.com/wp-json/)) using a card-based layout.  It also includes integrated test banner and interstitial ads.

## Features

* **Fetches and Displays Blog Posts:**  Retrieves posts from the specified WordPress API and presents them in an easy-to-read card format.  Includes post titles, (presumably) excerpts, and potentially images (depending on API response).
* **Card-Based Layout:**  Provides a visually appealing and user-friendly presentation of blog posts using cards.
* **Integrated Ad Monetization (Test):**  Includes placeholder banner ads displayed between posts and interstitial ads shown between page transitions.  These are *test* ads and are not connected to a live ad network.  Replace these with your actual ad implementation for production.


## Setup and Installation

**(Instructions will vary depending on the build system and Android Studio version used.  Update accordingly)**

1. **Clone the repository:**  `git clone <repository_url>`
2. **Open the project:** Open the cloned project in Android Studio.
3. **Build and Run:** Build the project and install it on an Android emulator or device.

## Technologies Used

* **Android SDK:**  (Specify the version)
* **Retrofit (or alternative):**  (Specify the HTTP client library used for API calls)
* **(Image loading library):** Glide, Picasso, Coil, etc. (Specify the library used to load images)

## Future Improvements
